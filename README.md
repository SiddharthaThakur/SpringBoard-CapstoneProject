# SpringBoard-CapstoneProject

My Capstone Project for the Data Intensive Course would be:

###**Predicting NFL scores and using the differentials to find efficient Vegas over/under betting strategy**  

The National Football League (NFL) is highly unpredictable and yet it resides comfortably as the king of the United Statesâ€™ thriving sports betting market. In this project, I would be using 2013, 2014 and 2015 play-by-play data to predict the score by each team at the end of the game.
