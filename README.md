# SpringBoard-CapstoneProject

My Capstone Project for the Data Intensive Course would be:

###**Predicting NFL scores and using the differentials to find efficient Vegas over/under or spread betting strategy**  

The National Football League (NFL) is highly unpredictable and yet it resides comfortably as the king of the United States’ thriving sports betting market. In this project, I would be using 2013, 2014 and 2015 play-by-play data to predict the score by each team at the end of the game. Once I have the total scores for each team in a matchup, I can use that to determine which type of bet (over/under, direct bets, or the spread) gives us more chance of winning. 

The reason I chose play-by-play data is because this would let me use my data to calculate the statistics for a particular team right before their weekly matchup. For example, for season 2014 week 6, I can calculate the total passing yards for Denver Broncos by looking in the first 5 week worth of play-by-play data. 

The start of this project would be something as simple as any linear regression technique using the usual statistics (Passing yard, Rushing yard, Receiving, Kicking, Kick Returns, Touchdowns, Offensive line, Fumbles, Rush defense, Pass defense, Sacks, Tackles, Interception, Red Zone Defense, Fumbles Forced, Fumbles Recovered and anything else based on the p values) for the teams. Next step can be using classification and regression trees to come up with different linear regression equations for different types of matchups. 

Once I have the scores, I can use that predicted situation and the archived Vegas odds right before the start of the game to determine an answer to these questions:

	* What matchups for that week provide the best chances of winning?
	* What matchups for that week provide the best winning to risk ratio?
	* What kind of bet should be provide a better chance of winning- Over/Under, Spread or Direct betting?
	* What combination of these bets would give me a highest chance of winning for the $200 I have?

I would be updating this Read-me as well as the repository as the project progresses.
